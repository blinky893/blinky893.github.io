title: On the looming sense of inadequacy at starting a blog
---

I'm not sure I've got anything interesting to write.

I think that's partly because I think when I think of writing a blog, I compare myself to those blogs with archives going back years and are full of categorised content and comments.

But what if the blog didn't have to be that?

What if ...?

- it was something much smaller?
- it was a fixed time/post experiment, rather than being something rivalling wikipedia?
